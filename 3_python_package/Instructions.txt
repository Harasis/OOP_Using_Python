We are going to convert our modularized Distributions code into a Python PACKAGE

A package is a collection of modules placed into a directory

A python package should contain __init__.py file
this file will tell python that this folder contains a package 
code in the init file gets run whenever you import a python package.
This init file is importing gaussian class from the Gaussian Distributions module.
We can even left __init__.py file empty-> works too. But we have done this to save some time as we donot need to explicitly
import gaussian class in all the files 

in Gaussiandistribution.py in 3rd line "from .Generaldistribution import Distribution" we added '.' before Generealdistribution
which is required for python3 

We also need Setup.py file  in the same folder as Distributions
this file is necessary for pip installation
pip will automatically look for this file 
this file contains the meta data about the package like package name, version, description , etc


######TO INSTALL#####

go to the terminal
	-> go to the directory with setup.py file
	#cd /..../python_package
	
	->then
	#pip install .

Now we can use this python package locally as

#python

>>>from distributions import Gaussian
>>>gaussian_one = Gaussian(10,5)
>>>gaussian_one.mean
10
>>>gaussian_one.stdev
5

--> To see where the package is installed locally

>>>import distributions
>>>distributions.__file__
\....\....\....\....\ <- this the position where this package is installed locally



THIS IS HOW YOU CAN CREATE AND INSTALL PY PACKAGE LOCALLY
