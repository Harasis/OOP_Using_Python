So far the we are doing coding exercises in Jupyter notebooks. 
Jupyter notebooks are especially useful for data science applications because we can wrangle data, analyze data and share a report all in one document; 
however, they're not ideal for writing modular programs, which require separating code into different files.

you'll find three files in this folder. 
Look at how the Distribution class and Gaussian class are modularized into different files. 

The Gaussiandistribution.py imports Distribution class from the Generaldistribution.py file. The line of code:

from Generaldistribution import Distribution

essentially pastes the Distribution code to the top of the Gaussiandistribution file when you run the code. 
You'll see in the example_code.py file an example of how to use the Gaussian class.

The example_code.py file then imports the Gaussian distribution class.
